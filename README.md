# Extract-to-Visualization-on-Yelp
As the Final project for the Data analysis boot camp at Iron Hack, this project is my effort. I designed a whole pipeline in this project, from extraction(E) to visualization(V). The feed is a subset of the Yelp open dataset. Azure Synapse workspace is the main tool for developing this project, I employed different features of the workplace like Azure data lake and dedicated SQL pools for extraction and loading, data flow, and notebooks to transform. Finally, the Power BI fabric workspace connected directly to the warehouse to explore the data set and illustrate the most needed insights about it.
